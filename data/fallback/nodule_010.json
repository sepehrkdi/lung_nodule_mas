    "report": "FINDINGS: A large 25.8mm spiculated mass is identified in the left lower lobe. The lesion demonstrates marked spiculation with poorly defined margins and significant lobulation. The mass appears to abut the pleural surface. No calcification is present. There is mild peribronchial thickening adjacent to the mass.\n\nIMPRESSION: Highly suspicious pulmonary mass in the left lower lobe with imaging features concerning for primary lung malignancy. Findings are highly suggestive of carcinoma. Recommend urgent tissue sampling via CT-guided biopsy or bronchoscopy for pathologic diagnosis. Staging CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and PET-CT recommended."
